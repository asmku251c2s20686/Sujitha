"""
Implement a function called sort_students that takes a list of 
student objects as input and sorts the lists based on their CGPA
( Cumulative Grade Point Average) in descending order. Each student object
has the following attributes: name
(string), roll_number(string), and 
cgpa(float). Test the function with 
different input lists of students.
